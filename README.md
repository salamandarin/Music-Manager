# Running Instructions

- Set working directory to "Music_Manager"
    - Same goes for running test executables
    - You probably need to do this if you get: `std::runtime_error: unable to open database file`
        - Program automatically makes database file if doesn't exist, so you only get this error if it's looking in the wrong spot
